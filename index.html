  <H1>The Neubot Project</H1>

  <P>The Neubot Project was <A href="https://nexa.polito.it/neubot">
  a project by the Nexa Center for Internet &amp; Society at Politecnico
  di Torino (DAUIN)</A>. The project started in June 2008
  and concluded on May 31, 2017. After this date,
  <A href="https://github.com/bassosimone">Simone Basso</A>
  has been maintaining the software tools originated by the
  Neubot project.</P>

  <P>This web page exists to document the status of Neubot after
  the original project at Nexa Center
  <A href="http://www.neubot.org/2019/01/retiring-neubot-client.html">
  has been shut down</A>.</P>

  <P>The spirit of the agreement around Neubot between Simone Basso
  and the Nexa Center is that the Neubot tool will be retired and the
  Neubot name will not be used anymore. Yet, it's fine for the DASH
  <A href="https://nexa.polito.it/publications/basso2014measuring">
  experiment researched and implemented as part of the Neubot project</A>
  to continue to exist. This experiment, in fact, was implemented by
  <A href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit">the
  Measurement Kit library</A> that was integrated by thousands of
  <A href="https://ooni.org/install">OONI mobile clients</A>.</P>

  <P>Accordingly, development of the DASH experiment continues in the
  <A href="https://github.com/neubot/dash">github.com/neubot/dash</A>
  GitHub repository. Because the Nexa Center is not directly responsible of
  the DASH experiment, we also of course updated the DASH experiment's
  privacy policy accordingly (see <A
  href="https://github.com/neubot/dash/pull/24">neubot/dash#24</A>).</P>

  <P>All the other repositories in the <A
  href="https://github.com/neubot">Neubot organisation</A>
  have been archived and all the corresponding
  software tools have been retired. The organisation is still jointly
  controlled by Simone Basso and (at least one) Nexa center representative.</P>

  <P>As of October 2020, <A href="https://ooni.org/install">OONI</A> continues to be
  the main integration of the DASH experiment.</P>

  <P>Because the DASH experiment is still deployed in production, we are
  evaluating improvements aimed at making it more performant and more
  accurate within the original spirit of measuring streaming-like performance.</P>
